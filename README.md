## Haptic CPR First Aid Guidance Application

- During the Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), an average adult is capable of maintaining correct rhythm, pace and depth of compression only for a minute. With average ambulance response time in UK being 8 minutes, other 7 minutes inaccurate CPR often determines the survival of the victim. The core problems of CPR are fatigue, defocusing on rhythm, incorrect rate and depth of compressions. The Haptic CPR application is a solution that mitigates and completely removes given problems. 

- The application platform has been planned for both Apple watch and iPhone but settled on iPhone only due to watch limitation that can be further explored in the report. The iPhone onboard hardware such as accelerometer and gyroscope allowed creation of two pivotal algorithms; compression depth and compression rate algorithms. Those algorithms calculate correct compression and depth from raw accelerometer data. Based on the given data, sound and visual guidance modules are responsible for keeping the user informed by sound alerts and statistical display of performance results that refresh every 10 seconds. 

- The goal of sound and visual guidance is to completely remove incorrect rate and depth of compressions by continuously adjusting the user’s performance until correct depth and pace is achieved. Furthermore, a revolutionary approach has been taken to mitigate incorrect rhythm, pace and fatigue. Through usage of taptic engine hardware of iPhone device, a haptic guidance module has been created that creates illusion of ‘feeling metronome’ through device vibration, the vibration dictates the rhythm and pace of 110 Beats Per Minute and mitigates fatigue through focus. User testing results have shown that users felt fully guided, where the guidance modules help them be aware of their performance and haptic guidance being the best module for helping them stay in correct rhythm and pace.

- The projects application delivers fully upon its aims by solving and mitigating the issues related to the CPR, however in the project results have also shown the importance of accurate instructions for application usage and importance of delivering the application onto older Apple iPhone devices.
